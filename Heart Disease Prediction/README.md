Heart Disease Prediction

Task Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features. Accurate prediction can help in early diagnosis and better management of patient health.

Dataset Used
We used the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle, which includes features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical indicators. The dataset is structured for supervised learning with a binary target indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

Models Applied
- Logistic Regression (LR): A linear model for binary classification.  
- Decision Tree (DT): A tree-based model that splits the data based on feature values to predict the target.

Key Results and Findings
- Logistic Regression achieved 81.9% accuracy  
- Decision Tree achieved 81.4% accuracy  

We observed that both models performed similarly, indicating that the dataset contains patterns that are effectively captured by both linear and non-linear models. LR slightly outperformed DT, suggesting a predominantly linear relationship between features and the target. These results show that machine learning models can provide meaningful predictions for heart disease detection and can be further improved with feature engineering or ensemble methods.
