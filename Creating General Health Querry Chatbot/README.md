General Health Query Chatbot (Prompt Engineering Based)

Task Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot capable of answering general health-related questions. The chatbot uses prompt engineering to provide clear, friendly, and educational responses while ensuring that it does not give harmful medical advice or recommend specific treatments or medications.

Dataset Used
No formal dataset was required for this project. The chatbot relies on a pre-trained large language model (LLM) Mistral-7B-Instruct, which has been trained on diverse textual data. User queries are provided interactively during conversation.

Models Applied
- Mistral-7B-Instruct (Hugging Face): A large instruction-tuned language model used to generate responses.
- Prompt Engineering: Customized prompts guide the model to behave as a medical assistant while adhering to safety constraints.
- Safety Filtering: Post-processing ensures that any response mentioning specific drugs or treatment recommendations is replaced with safe guidance.

Key Results and Findings
- The chatbot successfully provides general health information in a clear, friendly manner.
- Safety measures effectively prevent the model from giving treatment advice or recommending medications.
- The project demonstrates practical prompt engineering, model usage, and ethical AI design for conversational agents in the health domain.
